This directory contains a komega example done in c (kw_c), 
objective C (kw_o) and Python (kw_py).

The komega example is adapted from a previous komega example I developed
for the VSIPL tutorial held at Georgia Tech in Feb, 2002.

The purpose is to have a common example for VSIPL used with different 
baseline languages.
