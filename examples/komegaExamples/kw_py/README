To run this you need a python environment that includes matplotlib and numpy as 
well as the vsipl modules included with jvsip distribution.

To run at a command line type 

> python bf_ex.py

I also run by starting ipython. Looks like
> ipython --pylab
In [1]: from beamformer import *

In [2]: beamformer('param_file',2)
