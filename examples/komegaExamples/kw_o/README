This code is specific to an Apple objective-C environment. 

This code expects a VSIPL framework has been created. I call mine jvsipF

I use clang to compile from the command line or using the Makefile (make).

I suspect it will compile in other objective C environments but I am only
familiar with what Apple does. As well as VSIPL it uses the Foundation 
framework and I don't know the availability of that outside apple.

Note that plt.m is a file for ploting the output using Octave or Matlab. 
Don't confuse it with objective C code.

To compile I do
> clang -o beamformer_ex beamformer_ex.m param.m kw.m ts.m -framework jvsipF -framework Foundation
To run I do
> beamformer_ex param_file
To plot I open octave and cd to this directory. 
Typing 'plt' should cause the plot to happen.

The param file is just ascii text. To try other parameters edit with any
text editor.
