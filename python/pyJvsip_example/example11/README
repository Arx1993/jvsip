The output of example 11 is long and should be output to a file
For pyJvsip I have assumed matplotlib is installed. Make appropriate
changes (to example11.py) if that is not the case.
pythone example11.py should run and plot.

If no matplotlib
python example11.py >file.m 
file.m may be input into matlab for ploting

If you are using a notebook start it with
ipython notebook --pylab inline
