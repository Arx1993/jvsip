This directory contains a module which demonstrates a VSIPL inspired, python vector/matrix signal processing library.
The (pyJvsip) module imports the vsip module and the vsiputils module. They must be installed for pyJvsip to work properly.

STATUS
Draft and under development
I have used pyJvsip fairly extensively. It's bug quotient has been significantely reduced since version 0.1.
There is still much work to be done to extend pyJvsip to support all the functions supplied by the
JVSIP C Library
