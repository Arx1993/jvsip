This test uses givens rotations to calculate (in place) the R matrix of a QR decomposition

To run do 
 > python testGivens.py

To check copy matrix A into Matlab (or octave) and caculate R and comparet to
the R printed by the routine.

Test was originally done to debug a problem with the C VSIPL library. Problem
was found where I did not check for a division by zero. Python reported this where
C just did the division with a Nand return. So using python as a debug tool worked
in this case.
