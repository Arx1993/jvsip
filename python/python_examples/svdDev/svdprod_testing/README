In this directory are notebooks I developed to do simple
'feel good' tests on vsip_svdprodu and vsip_svdprodv functions.

Note these notebooks also demonstrate mixed code between
pyJvsip module and vsip module to test vsip functions
directly in python.  This eases testing and reduces 
development time.
