In this directory is a file svd_f.c which defines an svd for vsip float using C VSIPL code.

The file test_svd_f.c runs a simple example using routines defined in svd_f

The file svd_f.py mirrors the code in svd_f.c except using the vsip module and python. The goal 
is to demonstrate how to develop C code using python and vice versa for testing and development
purposes.  The notebook module test_svd_f.ipynb is the counterpoint to test_svd_f.  Comparison of
the python codes with the corresponding C codes is instructive and the main reason for including
this example.

Note this code is not as well tested as I would like and is probably buggy.  It is more important to
test and debug the actual pyJvsip and C VSIPL svd code and my time is a bit limited. This code was
originally developed when writing the C VSIPL routines and so I include it here.

To make the C code just do
gcc -o test_svd_f test_svd_f.c svd_f.c  -I<vsip.h directory> -L<vsip.h library directory> -lvsip
