This code is a proof of concept and is under development.

In this directory is svd code developed using the C VSIPL library. It is 
proof of concept and development code toward a native C VSIPL svd routine as 
defined in the VSIPL specification. The code should not be considered 
as well written from a performance or robustness point of view. Shortcuts
are taken to save development time.

The purpose of the code, beyond being a step in development of a native 
C VSIPL routine, is to serve as a demonstration of converting from pyJvsip 
code to C VSIPL code. In addition it demonstrates how to test C VSIPL 
code using swig and python VSIPL modules in tandem with the C code. 

NOTE
The make.sh file is a /bin/sh file to run swig and create the wrapper
code, compile the C VSIPL code and the wrapper code to object files, and to
create a library and python module suitable for loading into python.
The loaded library allows easy runring of the C VSIPL routines
without writing special main routines. This should simplify testing
and comparison between the C routines and the corresponding python 
routines.

NOTE
The decompositionUtilities.py file is included here for use by the 
svdUtilsTestNB notebook when testing. It contains the python code being
converted to C VSIPL. This file is a copy of the file with the same name
in  python/python_examples/matrixDecomposition of the jvsip distribution.
It is only included here for convenience. Probably should use a link.
