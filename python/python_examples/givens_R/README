This test uses givens rotations to calculate (in place) the R matrix of a QR decomposition

To run do 
 > python testGivens.py

To check copy matrix A into Matlab (or octave) and caculate R and compare to
the R printed by the routine.

Test was originally done to debug a problem with the C VSIPL library. Note code in
this directory 'VI_cgivens.c. This is the original C code with the bug still in it.
VI_givens_d.py is the python analog of VI_cgivens.c. Python recognized I was dividing
by zero making it easy to find and correct the problem in my c code.

So using python as a debug tool worked in this case.

The problem in the c code is line 55.
I correct this in the python version, lines 44-46.
