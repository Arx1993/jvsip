This directory contains development code for decomposition routines. 
While jvsip has most (VSIPL Defined) decomposition routines they can probably be 
improved and there is curently an incomplete SVD implementation. 
In addition eigenvalue decompositions would be useful in pyJvsip although
they are not defined in the VSIPL specification.

Although I am working on development here the code is also useful as example code for pyJvsip.

Note I have started using notebooks
http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html

Notebooks supports better documentation and an enhanced development environment. 
Notebook files are Those named <file-name>NB.ipynb. Generally I will produce the python content 
if it is usefull to a  <file-name>.py file for regular imports, and I may print the notebook
files to <file-name.pdf> so the rendered metadata can be displayed for users without notebook installed.
(<file-name>.pdf is stale. I may improve it in the future; or remove it)

Note that I have overwriten a notebook file by mistake using the .py file. If you drag a .py into the notebook
dashboard it will import it using the same name and store it over the notebook file; probably not what you
want. So I started placing a NB as part of the file name to ensure I don't overwright the docmentation 
version with the module version. (I was saved by time machine; but better to not do this).

Note underneath notebook has support for markdown 
http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
which supports, among other things, some math notation using latex.
