This directory contains development code for decomposition routines. It's purpose
is to document some of the routines used by C VSIPL for decomposition using
python notebooks; python code for demo routines, and markdown for documentation.

Eigenvalue decompositions would be useful in pyJvsip although
they are not defined in the VSIPL specification. Eigenvalue routines
may be developed here at some time in the future.
