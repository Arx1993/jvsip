In this directory I have a ctypes demo, pyCtypesJvsip.py, which demonstrates
another way to do a pyJvsip using the ctypes module. This would be a lot of
work but appears to be doable. There are some hickups requiring work-arounds.

In any case this is a work in progress which may or may not progress.

You need to create a shared object file for the vsip library and copy the
library into this directory. I did this with

gcc -shared -c *.c -o _vsip.so -I./

while in the c_VSIP_src directory at the top level of JVSIP.

If you have a commercial library which already has a dynamically linked lib
file you can probably use that one.

This module does not do much. For now read the module or email me for 
pointers on how to use.
