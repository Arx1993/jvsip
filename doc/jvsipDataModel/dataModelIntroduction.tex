\section{Introduction}
In this document I am proposing a standard data model for VSIPL. To be fair this is my notion of what a data model is. If there is some formal document describing what a data model is I don't know about it although there is a data model wikipedia page. The goal is for the data model to be language (as in programing language) independent.

I think the data model presented here is the same as in \cvl{} but I will call it the \jv{} data model so that if nobody else wants to participate in the discussion I will have a data model I can use for my own research interests.  I don't want to limit myself to just what is defined in the VSIPL 1p3 specification but I will try to generalize the ideas so they may be extended.

I don't expect this model to necessarily be complete as described here but I do expect it to be a starting point.  There may be some fuzzy sections. There may be some stuff that other folks disagree with. There may be some parts of the model which only apply for a particular language or platform.  But until somebody does a document and some discussion occurs the model will not go anywhere except for \jv{}.  I do eat my own cooking so to speak.

There are four parts to the model. The first is the scalar definitions which define the type of data that will be stored. The second is the block which is a memory abstraction providing an interface to memory allowing data to be stored in a machine independent way. The third is a \Vw{} which provides methods to allow an index set to be defined on a subset of the data stored in a block. For \cvl{} views are generally called vectors, matrices, or tensors but in general we could define other types of views. The final part of the data model is the interface between the data stored for use by \cvl{} functions (in blocks) and other functions which are not part of \cvl{}.
\paragraph{Single Thread Model}
The model I am proposing is for a library supporting a single thread. Under the covers the library might have multiple threads working; but from the user's perspective the code is a single thread.  If for instance pthreads are used, or a parallel model like MPI, then  VSIPL objects need to be protected from thread contention or race conditions the same as for any other multithreaded program using.
