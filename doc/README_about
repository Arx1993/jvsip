This directory includes documentation.
Some documents I have copied directly from TVCPP. 
These older documents should be updated but are a low priority for now.

A version of the VSIPL (through 2012) specification is included. There are a few
errors but overall it is a good document.

Note that the OMG specification group is adopting VSIPL as an official OMG specification. 
For the C++ spec (not part of jvsip) see
    http://www.omg.org/spec/VSIPL++/ 
and for the C spec (jvsip will try to keep up) see
    http://www.omg.org/spec/VSIPL/

I also include newer documents I am writing for the JVSIP distribution. All my documentation 
are under continuous (although not necessarily frequent) review and modification. 
I have been using LibreOffice as my documentation tool but I publish in PDF. I have
found LibreOffice allows embedding the LibreOffice Document inside the PDF. I have done this
for some of my documents, and plan to do it for all documents developed with LibreOffice.

Recently I have started doing some documentation within the ipython notebook environment.
See
    http://ipython.org/notebook.html
This environment allows use of the markdown documentation method which allows use of LaTeX
type math.  I will still try to do documents as PDF but the ability to do notebooks would
be helpful. 

Python documents, and any pyJvsip specification, are mine alone. Currently there is no "official" 
VSIPL python spec. If OMG does a VSIPL specification for python I probably will stay with what I have done 
and not try to implement to their spec.

Currently I am doing more of a proof of concept so decisions may change frequently. When I get something 
that I like for python VSIPL I may document it more fully.
