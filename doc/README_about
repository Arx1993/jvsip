This directory includes documentation.
Some documents I have copied directly from TVCPP. These older documents should be updated but are a low priority for now.

The official VSIPL specification is available at http://www.vsipl.org/
I include an annotated copy here. The annotations are mistakes I know are in the official document; or changes to the pdf document I would like to see. Fixing errors in the official document is painful and getting fixes finally approved seems to be impossible. For now I am looking for an easy way to publish (and document) problems. If somebody picks up editing the official document then they can use this as a resource.

I make annotations using Apples preview application. I have not researched how these annotations show up using other tools.

I also include newer documents. All my documentation are under continuos review and modification. I am currently using LibreOffice as my documentation tool but I (currently) only publish in PDF.

Python documents are mine alone. Currently there is no "official" VSIPL python spec so I am free to do what I want. Currently I am doing more of a proof of concept so decisions may change frequently. When I get something that I like for python VSIPL I may document it.
