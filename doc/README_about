This dirctory includes documentation.
Some documents are copied directly from TVCPP. These should be updated but are to much work for the moment.

The official VSIPL specification is available at http://www.vsipl.org/
I include an anotated copy here. The anotations are mistakes I know are in the official document
but have not been fixed. Fixing them is a little painful but getting the fixes through the forum is almost
imposible. So for now I will update this document with notes on things I find and perhaps someday there will
be a new official release with these misakes fixed.

I make my annotations using Apples preview application. I have not researched how these annotations show up
using other tools.

I also include newer documents. All my documentation is under continous review and modification. 

Python documents are mine alone. Currently there is no "official" vsipl python spec so I am free 
to do what I want.
