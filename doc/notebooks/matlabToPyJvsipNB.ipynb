      "We note that for the matlab version the author elected to get a length and then create a ramp directly when used to create matrix `A` and `A1` whereas in the pyJvsip version we create the ramp and just use it.  Without knowing the underlying mechanisim used by matlab for the use of the ramp vector I don't know how efficient there method is.  \n",

VSIP vectors have no direction and usage is defined by the function call. For matlab the direction of the vector is important when determining operations (such as outer product).   \n",
      "\n",
      "Also note that operators may be elementwise or not. For instance in matlab a matrix product is designated by a `*` but if an elementwise multiply is desired you use a period as in `.*`.  For pyJvsip a `*`, `+`, `-`, `/` always designate elementwise operations. Other operations are determined by a function or method. So for matlab `A * B` would be `A.prod(B)` in pyJvsip and `A .* B` in matlab would be `A * B` in pyJvsip."
