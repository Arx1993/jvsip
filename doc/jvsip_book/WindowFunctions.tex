When windows were defined in the VSIPL specification they were defined as standalone functions to create a compact block with a vector \ttbf{view} and fill the view with the window coefficients. I think this was an unfortunate way to do it; we would have been better off to first create the \ttbf{view} and then call a function to fill the view with the coefficients.

The method of window creation in C VSIPL makes it difficult to encapsulate windows into the \pyjv{} methods and functions; and I don't want to create a special class just for windows. Consequently window creation has become part of the \ttbf{Block} class for \pyjv.
