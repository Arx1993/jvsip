\subsection*{Scalar Functions\hspace*{\fill}\hyperlink{VSIPspecHead}{(up)}\hypertarget{ScalarFunctions}{}}\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Scalar Functions}
In general I do not define scalar functions in \pyjv.  Ease of use is a major goal of the \pyjv{} module and to further this goal I decided scalars used by or returned by \pyjv{} functions should be normal python scalars. Using scalar functions (such as $\cos$, $\sin$, etc.) imported from the math module or the numpy module should work fine. That said, you can always use the C VSIPL scalar functions directly since they are in the \ttbf{vsip} module which is included in the \pyjv{} module.
