\subsection*{VSIPL Addendum}\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{VSIPL Addendum}
Editing the VSIPL specification was becoming difficult because of its length and instabilities in the MS Word source document. When functions were added to the specification for interpolation, permutation and sorting they were added as separate documents in a addendum and basically glued onto the pdf. This allowed for much less editing of the MS Word source document.
