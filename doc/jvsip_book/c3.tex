\chapter{Introduction to JVSIP Programming}
\section*{Introduction}
In this section we cover some basics to programing in the JVSIP environment. The expectation is the user will
prototype a function in python, perhaps using the ipython and notebook environments, and then write the
working function in C and then encapsulate the C routine using SWIG to test in the python environment.
