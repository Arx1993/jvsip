\afuncT{submatrix}{Create indexed sub-matrix. The method \ttbf{submatrix} is done out-of-place by \ttbf{view}s of type matrix. It will either create a new child matrix by first dropping an indexed row and column from the parent matrix, or by copying selected rows and columns from a parent matrix to the child matrix. A new block space and matrix is created for the output by the method.}{}
