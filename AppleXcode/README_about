Current Xcode is  Version 8.0 (8A218a)
jvsipF
The jvsipF directory contains an xcode project which should allow one to create
a framework, called jvsipF, with a jvsip library. I am not sure this will work
when translated to an apple computer other than my own; so your mileage
may vary.

vsip
The vsip directory contains an xcode project which should allow one to create 
a framework called vsip.  The vsip framework should create a module style framework 
for use with swift.  A simple example target (vsipExampleAdd) is included. This a work in
progress.  There is much I do not understand about modules.
Naming is set up so that vsip.h can be used for the umbrella header.
In Xcode for the 'vsip' target in "Build Settings" under "Packaging" 
   "Defines Module"
Should be set to "yes".  This causes Xcode to create the module file in the Framework
hierarchy. 

SwiftVsip
This is a very preliminary example of a VSIP Swift Module.  Need to include vsip module
above to build.  Code Objectizes vsipl and lets the ARC handle destroys.
