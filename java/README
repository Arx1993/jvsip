In this directory is Java Code for a proof-of-concept of C VSIPL working in Java. 

I use SWIG and a vsip.i file created for java to create JNI code.

For this example the SWIG incantation is
swig -java -package cvsip vsip.i

To create the object file for the wrapper I use (Your Include directories may not be the same)
cc -c vsip_wrap.c -I/Users/judd/local/src/jvsip/include -I/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Headers


To make the library on OS X I use

To make the cvsip package do
javac *.java
