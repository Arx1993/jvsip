Introduction
A more complete document (pdf) called jvsip_howToMake is availale in the doc directory.

These instructions assume you have the JVSIP distribution in a directory at $HOME/jvsip.
You can put the distribution and name the directory anything; there is no requirement for
it to actually reside in $HOME or be called jvsip.

Making and installing the C vsipl library.
There is a Makefile in $HOME/jvsip.  This top level Makefile is for creating the C VSIPL library. 
You should use GNU's make.  Typing 
> make
in the $HOME/jvsip directory should create a libvsip.a in the c_VSIP_src directory;
create a $HOME/jvsip/lib directory and a $HOME/jvsip/include directory; and then copy
libvsip.a into $HOME/jvsip/lib and copy vsip.h into $HOME/jvsip/include . Note this
is the location makefiles in testing and example code will look for these items.

You can also go directly in  $HOME/jvsip/c_VSIP_src and make there. This will just 
create the libvsip.a file in $HOME/jvsip/c_VSIP_src.

If you want to install into /usr/local (or some other standard location) then all you
need to do is copy libvsip.a and vsip.h to those locations.

Making the baseline test
Inside $HOME/jvsip/c_VSIP_testing is a lot of (fairly ugly) code designed to exercise
the C VSIPL routines enough to give one some confidence that most things work. 
I make this with a shell script. To create the tests do
> cd $HOME/local/jvsip/c_VSIP_testing
> sh gen_all.sh
This should create a file called test_all.c and compile it into an executable called
test_all. To run do
>./test_all | grep error
or
>./test_all >output
or just
>./test_all

Creating and installing the vsip python module
To make the vsip python module cd to ./python/vsip
You need a tool called swig (www.swig.org). I assume you have it as well as any other
development tools (such as c, make, etc.) from the vsip directory use swig to create 
the wrapper files and vsip.py. Then use setup.py to create and install the vsip module. Should look
something like

swig -python vsip.i
python setup.py install

Note the swig I was using was SWIG Version 2.0.4. I believe this version
should make a wrapper suitable for python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2

There are several ways to do the install.
You can do a build first and then do the install as above
python setup.py build
python setup.py install

If you don't have permisions to install you can also install into a user space
python setup.py install --user

To create and install the vsiputils python module cd into python/vsiputils. 
Note this module is not well tested and is very much alpha code.
Also not vsiputils requires the vsip module. It overloads VSIPL functionality
and adds some support.  
To install I generally do
> python setup.py install --user

Creating and installing the vsipUser python module
cd into python/vsipUser
> python setup.py install --user
