This directory holds C Source code needed to build the jvsip VSIPL C Library.

To Build (if all else fails) try

cc -c *.c -I./
ar rcvs libvsip.a *.o

To use include vsip.h (in this directory; put it in a handy place) and link
with libvsip.a .

There are other ways to make this library and lots of flags you can try. This is the most brain dead way if you just want to try it out; don't know a lot about C or libraries; and can't get the Makefile to work properly for you. This code
depends only on an ansi C89 compliant compiler to build.

For minor version 0.3.0 the major change is moving long integer code to use _li as the precision indicator.  Previously I was using _l but that is defined as long double and _li is long integer.  This mistake has been in the code for years and I only just noticed it. If people have problems email me.
