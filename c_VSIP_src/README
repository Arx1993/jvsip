This directory holds C Source code needed to build the jvsip VSIPL C Library.

To Build (if all else fails) try

cc -c *.c -I./
ar rcvs libvsip.a *.o

To use include vsip.h (in this directory; put it in a handy place) and link
with libvsip.a .

There are other ways to make this library and lots of flags you can try. This is the most brain dead way if you just want to try it out; don't know a lot about C or libraries; and can't get the Makefile to work properly for you. This code
depends only on an ansi C89 compliant compiler to build.
